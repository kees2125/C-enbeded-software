 * $Log: sock_var.h,v $
 * Revision 1.9  2006/03/21 21:22:19  drsung
 * Enhancement made to TCP state machine. Now TCP options
 * are read from peer and at least the maximum segment size is stored.
 *
 * Revision 1.8  2005/08/02 17:46:49  haraldkipp
 * Major API documentation update.
 *
 * Revision 1.7  2005/06/05 16:48:25  haraldkipp
 * Additional parameter enables NutUdpInput() to avoid responding to UDP
 * broadcasts with ICMP unreachable messages. Fixes bug #1215192.
 *
 * Revision 1.6  2004/07/30 19:54:46  drsung
 * Some code of TCP stack redesigned. Round trip time calculation is now
 * supported. Fixed several bugs in TCP state machine. Now TCP connections
 * should be more reliable under heavy traffic or poor physical connections.
 *
 * Revision 1.5  2004/03/16 16:48:44  haraldkipp
 * Added Jan Dubiec's H8/300 port.
 *
 * Revision 1.4  2004/01/14 19:33:13  drsung
 * New TCP output buffer handling
 *
 * Revision 1.3  2003/11/24 21:00:21  drsung
 * Packet queue added for UDP sockets.
 *
 * Revision 1.2  2003/07/13 19:32:12  haraldkipp
 * Faster TCP transfers by changing receive buffer
 *
 * Revision 1.1.1.1  2003/05/09 14:41:22  haraldkipp
 * Initial using 3.2.1
 *
 * Revision 1.10  2003/02/04 18:00:53  harald
 * Version 3 released
 *
 * Revision 1.9  2002/09/03 17:50:18  harald
 * Configurable receive buffer size
 *
 * Revision 1.8  2002/08/16 17:54:19  harald
 * Count out of sequence drops
 *
 * Revision 1.7  2002/06/26 17:29:29  harald
 * First pre-release with 2.4 stack
 *
