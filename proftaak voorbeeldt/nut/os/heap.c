 * $Log: heap.c,v $
 * Revision 1.11  2006/10/05 17:26:15  haraldkipp
 * Fixes bug #1567729. Thanks to Ashley Duncan.
 *
 * Revision 1.10  2006/09/29 12:26:14  haraldkipp
 * All code should use dedicated stack allocation routines. For targets
 * allocating stack from the normal heap the API calls are remapped by
 * preprocessor macros.
 * Stack allocation code moved from thread module to heap module.
 * Adding static attribute to variable 'available' will avoid interference
 * with application code. The ugly format macros had been replaced by
 * converting all platform specific sizes to unsigned integers.
 *
 * Revision 1.9  2005/08/02 17:47:04  haraldkipp
 * Major API documentation update.
 *
 * Revision 1.8  2005/07/26 15:49:59  haraldkipp
 * Cygwin support added.
 *
 * Revision 1.7  2005/04/30 16:42:42  chaac
 * Fixed bug in handling of NUTDEBUG. Added include for cfg/os.h. If NUTDEBUG
 * is defined in NutConf, it will make effect where it is used.
 *
 * Revision 1.6  2004/11/08 18:15:02  haraldkipp
 * Very bad hack to support 32-bit boundaries.
 *
 * Revision 1.5  2004/04/07 12:13:58  haraldkipp
 * Matthias Ringwald's *nix emulation added
 *
 * Revision 1.4  2004/03/19 09:05:12  jdubiec
 * Fixed format strings declarations for AVR.
 *
 * Revision 1.3  2004/03/16 16:48:45  haraldkipp
 * Added Jan Dubiec's H8/300 port.
 *
 * Revision 1.2  2003/07/20 16:04:36  haraldkipp
 * Nicer debug output
 *
 * Revision 1.1.1.1  2003/05/09 14:41:49  haraldkipp
 * Initial using 3.2.1
 *
 * Revision 1.18  2003/05/06 18:53:10  harald
 * Use trace flag
 *
 * Revision 1.17  2003/03/31 14:53:30  harald
 * Prepare release 3.1
 *
 * Revision 1.16  2003/02/04 18:15:56  harald
 * Version 3 released
 *
 * Revision 1.15  2002/06/26 17:29:44  harald
 * First pre-release with 2.4 stack

 * Allocate a block from heap memory.
 *
 * This functions allocates a memory block of the specified
 * size and returns a pointer to that block.
 *
 * The actual size of the allocated block is larger than the
 * requested size because of space required for maintenance
 * information. This additional information is invisible to
 * the application.
 *
 * The routine looks for the smallest block that will meet
 * the required size and releases it to the caller. If the
 * block being requested is usefully smaller than the smallest
 * free block then the block from which the request is being
 * met is split in two. The unused portion is put back into
 * the free-list.
 *
 * The contents of the allocated block is unspecified.
 * To allocate a block with all bytes set to zero use
 * NutHeapAllocClear().
 *
 * \note Do not use this function in interrupt routines.
 *
 * \param size Size of the requested memory block.
 *
 * \return Pointer to the allocated memory block if the
 *         function is successful or NULL if the requested
 *         amount of memory is not available.
