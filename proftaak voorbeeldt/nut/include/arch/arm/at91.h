 * \brief AT91 peripherals.
 *
 * \verbatim
 *
 * $Log: at91.h,v $
 * Revision 1.10  2006/08/31 19:04:08  haraldkipp
 * Added support for the AT91SAM9260 and Atmel's AT91SAM9260 Evaluation Kit.
 *
 * Revision 1.9  2006/08/01 07:35:59  haraldkipp
 * Exclude function prototypes when included by assembler.
 *
 * Revision 1.8  2006/07/05 07:45:25  haraldkipp
 * Split on-chip interface definitions.
 *
 * Revision 1.7  2006/06/28 17:22:34  haraldkipp
 * Make it compile for AT91SAM7X256.
 *
 * Revision 1.6  2006/05/25 09:09:57  haraldkipp
 * API documentation updated and corrected.
 *
 * Revision 1.5  2006/04/07 12:57:00  haraldkipp
 * Fast interrupt doesn't require to store R8-R12.
 *
 * Revision 1.4  2006/03/02 20:02:56  haraldkipp
 * Added ICCARM interrupt entry code. Probably not working, because I
 * excluded an immediate load.
 *
 * Revision 1.3  2006/01/05 16:52:49  haraldkipp
 * Baudrate calculation is now based on NutGetCpuClock().
 * The AT91_US_BAUD macro had been marked deprecated.
 *
 * Revision 1.2  2005/11/20 14:44:14  haraldkipp
 * Register offsets added.
 *
 * Revision 1.1  2005/10/24 10:31:13  haraldkipp
 * Moved from parent directory.
