/*
 * $Log: nutinit.c,v $
 * Revision 1.13  2006/09/29 12:39:51  haraldkipp
 * Spurious interrupt handling on all supported AT91 devices.
 *
 * Revision 1.12  2006/07/26 11:17:16  haraldkipp
 * Defining AT91_PLL_MAINCK will automatically determine SAM7X clock by
 * reading PLL settings.
 *
 * Revision 1.11  2006/07/18 14:04:10  haraldkipp
 * Low level hardware initialization moved to crtat91sam7x256_rom.S. This
 * avoids the ugly jump from C code back into the runtime initialization.
 * Watchdog reset (tiger bell) removed from idle thread.
 *
 * Revision 1.10  2006/07/15 11:13:30  haraldkipp
 * CPU ran into the data pool of Sam7xLowLevelInit(). Temporarily
 * fixed by Andras Albert with an additional global label in the
 * startup code. Furthermore Andras changed the clock initialization.
 * The CPU is now running at 47.9232 MHz and the MAC starts working.
 * Great, TCP/IP is now running on the SAM7X.
 *
 * Revision 1.9  2006/07/10 14:27:03  haraldkipp
 * C++ will use main instead of NutAppMain. Contributed by Matthias Wilde.
 *
 * Revision 1.8  2006/07/05 07:57:52  haraldkipp
 * Daidai's support for AT91SAM7X added. Possibly taken from Atmel.
 * May require new coding from ground up in order to not conflict with
 * original copyright.
 * Nevertheless, many thanks to Daidai for providing his adaption.
 *
 * Revision 1.7  2006/06/28 17:22:34  haraldkipp
 * Make it compile for AT91SAM7X256.
 *
 * Revision 1.6  2006/03/02 19:43:11  haraldkipp
 * Added MCU specific hardware initialization routine. This should be done
 * later for all MCUs to avoid contaminating NutInit() with MCU specific
 * stuff. For the AT91 the spurious interrupt handler has been added,
 * which fixes SF 1440948.
 *
 * Revision 1.5  2006/02/23 15:34:00  haraldkipp
 * Support for Philips LPC2xxx Family and LPC-E2294 Board from Olimex added.
 * Many thanks to Michael Fischer for this port.
 *
 * Revision 1.4  2005/10/24 09:22:29  haraldkipp
 * Default idle and main thread stack sizes increased.
 * AT91 header file moved.
 *
 * Revision 1.3  2005/08/02 17:46:45  haraldkipp
 * Major API documentation update.
 *
 * Revision 1.2  2005/07/26 16:17:03  haraldkipp
 * Use default stack sizes for main and idle, if none had been defined.
 *
 * Revision 1.1  2005/05/27 17:16:40  drsung
 * Moved the file.
 *
 * Revision 1.4  2005/04/05 17:52:41  haraldkipp
 * Much better implementation of GBA interrupt registration.
 *
 * Revision 1.3  2004/11/08 18:58:59  haraldkipp
 * Configurable stack sizes
 *
 * Revision 1.2  2004/09/08 10:19:23  haraldkipp
 * Made it look more general
 *
 * Revision 1.1  2004/03/16 16:48:46  haraldkipp
 * Added Jan Dubiec's H8/300 port.
 *
