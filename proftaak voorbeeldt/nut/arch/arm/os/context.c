 * $Log: context.c,v $
 * Revision 1.5  2006/03/16 19:06:16  haraldkipp
 * Use link register to jump into thread and use dedicated routine to
 * jump into the idle thread. The way we did start the idle thread
 * before, jumping into the middle of NutThreadSwitch(), doesn't work
 * with optimized code.
 *
 * Revision 1.4  2006/03/16 15:25:00  haraldkipp
 * Changed human readable strings from u_char to char to stop GCC 4 from
 * nagging about signedness.
 *
 * Revision 1.3  2005/10/24 09:09:41  haraldkipp
 * Switch frame reduced.
 * NutThreadEntry included in the execution path.
 * The 'cc' globber had been removed from the context switching asm macro,
 * after Michael Fischer found out that this fixes a problem with optimized
 * compilation. Unfortunately, compiler optimized binaries still seem to
 * run unreliable.
 *
 * Revision 1.2  2005/08/02 17:46:45  haraldkipp
 * Major API documentation update.
 *
 * Revision 1.1  2005/07/26 18:10:48  haraldkipp
 * Moved from os/thread.c
 *
 * Revision 1.1  2005/05/27 17:16:40  drsung
 * Moved the file.
 *
 * Revision 1.4  2005/04/05 17:54:36  haraldkipp
 * Moved from user mode to system mode. Probably breaks the GBA port.
 *
 * Revision 1.3  2004/11/08 19:15:33  haraldkipp
 * Made assembly includes look nicer.
 * Changed mode from supervisory to user supervisory, which seems to work
 * with the GBA.
 * Skipped entry frame, because it simply confuses me. :-)
 *
 * Revision 1.2  2004/09/08 10:19:31  haraldkipp
 * Tyou's support for the ARM7
 *
 * Revision 1.1  2004/03/16 16:48:46  haraldkipp
 * Added Jan Dubiec's H8/300 port.
 *
 * Revision 1.2  2004/02/18 16:32:48  drsung
 * Bugfix in NutThreadCreate. Thanks to Mike Cornelius.
 *
 * Revision 1.1  2004/02/01 18:49:48  haraldkipp
 * Added CPU family support
 *
