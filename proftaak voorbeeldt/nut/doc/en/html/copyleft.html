<b>Preamble</b><p>
Whilst the GNU General Public License is generally suitable for most operating system applications within a workstation or server environment, it presents certain obstacles that prevent its wide acceptance within many embedded application fields. In particular the requirements that prevent the linking of software licensed under the GPL with software that is not licensed under the GPL present a serious problem to many would-be users who for various reasons are unable to comply with this.<p>
With this in mind, Liquorice is released with the a special exception to the GNU Public License that permits some additional uses of the software.<p>
<b>Special Exception</b><p>
If you choose to link software from Liquorice with other files to produce an executable, this does not by itself cause the resulting executable to be covered by the GNU General Public License. Your use of the executable is in no way restricted on account of linking the Liquorice code with it.<p>
This exception does not however invalidate any other reason why the executable file might be covered by the GNU General Public License.<p>
This exception applies only to the code released by David J. Hudson and any other identified copyright holder under the name Liquorice. If you copy other code that is released by its copyright holder under the GNU General Public License into a copy of Liquorice, as the GNU General Public License permits, then this exception does not apply to the code that you add in this way. To avoid misleading anyone as to the status of such modified files, you must delete references to this exception notice from them.<p>
If you write modifications of your own for Liquorice, it is your choice whether to permit this exception to apply to your modifications. If you do not wish this, delete references to this exception notice from the affected files. <hr>
